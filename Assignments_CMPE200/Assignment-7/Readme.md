For assignment 7, we will further extend the single-cycle CPU to a system-on-chip (SoC) system which includes the pipelined MIPS processor, a factorial accelerator, and a simple general-purpose IO (GPIO) unit. You will also need to analyze the performance for both the software and hardware versions of factorial calculation. And the detailed description is here:
