We have finished the preparation work for implementing the MIPS processor in assignment 5. In assignment 6, we will move on to extend the single-cycle CPU so that it can support more instructions. This assignment will be done by 2-student teams. If you fully understand Assignment 5, you can very easily extend the processor by following the method used in the original code. And a group of 2 students should be more than enough to finish this assignment well. So, please use this opportunity to foster your collaborations to prepare for the next assignment. The description of assignment 6 is as below:

And the needed code is here. This is basically the code we used in assignment 5 with very minor differences. It also includes the test program to validate your extended design:
